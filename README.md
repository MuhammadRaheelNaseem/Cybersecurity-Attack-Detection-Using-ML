Strategies to Detect Cyber Attacks\n","\n","\n","1. The first approach to detecting cyber attacks is to use **rule-based system**. These systems use a set of predefined rules to identify potential attacks based on known attack patterns. For example, a rule might flag an attack if the source to destination time to live (sttl) value is less than 10 and the count of states time to live (ct_state_ttl) value is greater than 100. While rule-based systems can be effective in detecting known attacks, they may also produce false positives, so it's important to validate the alerts generated by these systems.\n","\n","| <img src=\"https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMSkillsNetwork-GPXX0Q8REN/images/simple_rule_system.png\" width=\"300\" alt=\"Simple Rule-Based System\"></img> |\n","|:--:| \n","| *Simple Rule-Based System* |\n","\n","2. Another approach to detecting cyber attacks is to use **machine learning algorithms**, such as Random Forest and adaboost. These algorithms are trained on a large dataset of network packets and can be used to identify anomalies in real-time network traffic that might indicate an attack. For example, a machine learning model might detect an attack if the destination to source transaction bytes (rate) value is greater than 10,000.\n","\n","| <img src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2019/01/22/10/58/pixel-cells-3947912_1280.png\" width=\"200\" alt=\"Cyber attack image\"> |\n","|:--:| \n","| *image credit: https://pixabay.com/* |\n","\n","3. In addition to these automated methods, **human analysis** can play a critical role in identifying cyber attacks. Human analysts can use their expertise to interpret the data and understand the context in which the attack is taking place. They can also validate the alerts generated by automated systems and take into account the broader context of the organization when analyzing data. For example, they may understand that a particular system is undergoing maintenance and can disregard anomalies in the data that might otherwise indicate an attack.\n","\n","| <img src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2018/03/11/06/15/cyber-security-3216076_1280.jpg\" width=\"200\" alt=\"human analysis\"> |\n","|:--:| \n","| *image credit: https://pixabay.com/* |\n","\n","Therefore, our strategy involves utilizing establishing a rule-based system as the first layer of detection. Then, we utilize a machine learning algorithm to pinpoint attacks. Finally, we delve into the variables to understand their significance and examine their importance as indicators of cyber attacks. This will contribute to developing cyber security knowledge for human analysis.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d28c2f8a-b926-4cad-9168-8b2048a9d81a","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["--------------------------------\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"217405fa-30c3-4c3b-9ebd-a323d0ab0fbc","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## 4.

However, it's important to note that the default rules are not comprehensive and may not provide complete coverage for all possible attack scenarios.\n","\n","\n","| <img src=\"https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMSkillsNetwork-GPXX0Q8REN/images/snort.png\" width=\"300\" alt=\"Cyber attack image\"> |\n","|:--:| \n","| *source: https://www.snort.org/* |\n","\n","Covering the implementation of `Snort` will be beyond the scope of this project; However, here are some general steps to get started with `Snort`:\n","\n","> 1. Install Snort: You can [download Snort from the official website](https://www.snort.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkGuidedProjectsIBMSkillsNetworkGPXX0Q8REN2117-2023-01-01), and install it on your system. Make sure to follow the instructions carefully.\n","> 2. Configure Snort: Once Snort is installed, you will need to configure it. This includes setting up the network interface to monitor, defining the rules that Snort should use to detect suspicious traffic, and specifying the logging and alerting options.\n","> 3. Create Rules: Snort uses rules to detect various types of suspicious activity. Rules are typically written in a specific format, and include information such as the type of traffic to monitor, the conditions for detection, and the alerting options. You can write your own custom rules, or use pre-defined rules that come with Snort.\n","> 4. Start Snort: Once Snort is installed and configured, you can start it to begin monitoring traffic on the specified network interface. Snort will run in the background, and will generate alerts or log events when suspicious activity is detected.\n","> 5. Analyze Alerts: When Snort detects suspicious activity, it will generate alerts or log events, depending on your configuration. You can then use these alerts to investigate and respond to the detected activity.\n","\n","It is important to note that using Snort effectively requires a solid understanding of networking, security, and the various threats that can be detected. It is recommended that you invest time in learning these topics and building your skills before using Snort in a production environment.\n","\n","**_However, keep in mind that rule-based models may not be enough to protect against cyber attacks, especially in cloud services where more sophisticated strategies are needed.

about some of the important features for detecting the type of cyber attack.\n","\n","`sttl`: Source to destination time to live value can be used to detect attacks such as packet fragmentation or tunneling that can increase the number of hops or decrease the TTL value. These techniques are often used by attackers to avoid detection or bypass security measures. A higher value for sttl may indicate the presence of such techniques.\n","\n","`ct_state_ttl` and `state`: These features reflect the various stages of TCP connections and can be related to port scanning, SYN flood, or DDoS attacks. Attackers can exploit the state of TCP connections using different techniques, which may be reflected in the values of ct_state_ttl and state.\n","\n","`rate`: This feature can represent various types of traffic rates or frequencies. Attackers may generate high traffic rates or bursts of traffic to overwhelm or bypass security measures, which may be reflected in a higher value for rate.\n","\n","`dload`: A decrease in the download speed may indicate an attack that consumes network bandwidth, such as DDoS attacks or worm propagation. A lower value for dload may be reflective of such attacks.\n","\n","The different types of attacks can have different characteristics that can be detected using network variables. For example, DoS attacks aim to disrupt the normal functioning of a system, so an increase in the rate of traffic or a decrease in the download speed may indicate the presence of such an attack. Port scanning, SYN flood, and DDoS attacks can be reflected in the values of ct_state_ttl and state. Fuzzers and analysis attacks may involve generating large amounts of traffic, which can be reflected in the value of rate. Reconnaissance attacks involve gathering information about a target system, which can potentially be detected by analyzing network traffic. Finally, shellcode and worm attacks can be detected by analyzing the content of network packets.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d3da833a-a685-495b-aded-be13eb789f75","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["### Bonus Exercise - Run Deep Neural Network On The Dataset \n"]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"67a74182-6375-4bae-9421-0917fa6c75e9","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[" # write your code here"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"396f97b9-cbf8-4f8c-a3e6-1706d34cbcda","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["<details>\n","    <summary>Click here for Solution</summary>\n","\n","```python\n","from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout\n","from keras.models import Sequential\n","from keras.optimizers import Adam\n","from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error , auc\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","\n","# Scale the data\n","scaler = StandardScaler()\n","X = scaler.fit_transform(X)\n","\n","# Create a DNN model\n","\n","model = Sequential()\n","# The Input Layer\n","model.add(Dense(512, activation='relu', input_dim = X_train.shape[1]))\n","\n","# The Hidden Layers\n","model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))\n","model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))\n","\n","# The Output Layer\n","\n","model.add(Dense(2, activation='softmax'))\n","\n","# Compile the network\n","model.compile(optimizer='adam',\n","              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',\n","              metrics=['accuracy'])\n","model.summary()\n","\n","model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5)\n","\n","```\n","\n","</details>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1b0b5f1d-7f84-4032-84ee-8c4c9acc8f5c","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## 8. Cyber Security for Cloud Services\n","\n","\n","We may scratch the surface, but as you start implementing your system, you will inevitably encounter complex issues. However, there are powerful cybersecurity tools available that you should consider.\n","\n","\n","\n","The complexities of cybersecurity in cloud services include shared responsibility, data privacy, complex architecture, multi-tenancy, regulatory compliance, and vulnerability to attacks. To mitigate these risks, effective cybersecurity strategies must be in place.\n","\n","Implementing cybersecurity measures for cloud computing can be particularly challenging due to several reasons, such as:\n","\n","> 1. Shared responsibility: In cloud computing, the responsibility for security is shared between the cloud provider and the customer, which can lead to confusion and a lack of clear ownership over security issues.\n","> 2. Complex architecture: Cloud environments typically have a complex and dynamic architecture, making it difficult to implement and manage effective security controls.\n","> 3. Multi-tenancy: Cloud providers often use multi-tenant infrastructure, where multiple customers share the same physical and virtual resources. This can lead to security risks, such as the accidental or intentional exposure of one customer's data to another.\n","> 4. Regulatory compliance: Organizations must comply with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which can be difficult to achieve in a cloud environment.\n","> 5. Vulnerability to attacks: Cloud environments are vulnerable to attacks such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, malware, and unauthorized access, making it critical to implement appropriate measures to mitigate the risks.\n","\n","Therefore, implementing effective cybersecurity measures in cloud computing requires a comprehensive and multi-layered approach to address these challenges and secure sensitive data and systems.\n","\n","### 8.1 IBM QRadar\n","\n","[IBM Security® QRadar® Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)](https://www.ibm.com/products/qradar-siem?utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkGuidedProjectsIBMSkillsNetworkGPXX0Q8REN2117-2023-01-01&utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_term=10006555) helps security teams detect, prioritize and respond to threats across the enterprise.
